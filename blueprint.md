# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game implemented in C. The game generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has to guess this number.

## How to Play

The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 10. If you guess a number out of this range, you will be asked to retry. You have a limit of 3 guesses and 2 retries.
